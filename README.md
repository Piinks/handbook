# Handbook

Shorebird company handbook.  Modeled after [GitLab's
handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/).

The Shorebird handbook is the central repository of how we run the company.  It
is a living document that is updated as we learn and grow.  We welcome your
feedback and contributions.

The doc got big, so I split it into sections:

# Sections
* [Company](company.md)
* [Engineering](engineering.md)
* [Onboarding](onboarding.md)
* [CEO](ceo.md)
